# This is Genie: The Machine-Learning Powered Sentiment Analysis Generator

This is a project created by me (A.J Bamgbelu) in order to tackle hate speech online. The intended use case is for Social media moderators to use this tool to search up the machine predicted sentiment of trending topics on Social media wesbites such as Twitter. In this case, they will be able to optimally see topics that will need more moderation.

This is the general sentiment functionality. In the example shown above, the machine predicted that the statement "Happy" carries positive connotation, which is certianly the truth as most people would agree upon.

This is the Twitter sentiment functionality. In the example shown above, the machine predicted ,after aggregating all the tweets containing the keyword, that the topic the "Mavericks" generally carried a positive association among most twitter users on the platform. Which makes sense given that of the time of the screenshot, they had just defeated the Pheonix Suns in a blowout win.


# Technology Used

In order to build this application, I utilized numerous Python libraries including: TextBlob and NLTK (for Sentiment Analysis and Database-trained Natural Language Processing Algorithms), Tweepy (for the aggregation of user tweets), and streamlit (for data visualization)
